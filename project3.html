<h4>Project3: A Floppy Disk Shell (Due at 11:59:59pm on 04/19/2015 (EST))</h4>

<h4 class="new"><a href="./project3_group.txt">Group Arrangment.</a></h4>

Floppy disk image: <a href="../imagefile.img">Another image file</a>: this image file was used to grade your project2, just for your reference.  However, I may use a different file to grade your project3.

<p class="new">Questions? Please first check our <a href="./proj3_qna.html">FAQ link</a> before you submit your inquiries.</p>

<p>Based on the floppy disk program you have developed in project, you are asked to change the program to a floppy shell that supports Linux shell commands in addition to your existing floppy disk related commands.  You are expected to use C programming language.  
Your implementation must work on Linux machine in BU004b lab.  </p>

<h4> Required Modules: </h4>

<ol>
<li>(10 points) Your shell should repeatedly display a prompt and allow 
the user to enter a command to run.  Your shell is supposed to read the input
from system standard input, parse the line with command and arguments, and execute.
You may want to use <tt>fork()</tt> and <tt>exec*()</tt> system calls.
<ul>
<li>Your shell should find the build-in command (see part2) in your current working 
directory first.  If not found, it should search the directories in the shell's
pathname environment (see part2).</li>
<li>You are not allowed to use system(), as it invokes the system's /bin/sh shell.
You should not use <tt>execlp()</tt> or <tt>execvp()</tt>, because your shell has its own path 
variable (explained in part2).
<li>By convention, the command arguments are seperated by white spaces.  Please
describe your customized argument seperation rules in your README document 
if you have special arrangement (not recommended though).  Your shell does not
need to handle special characters, like ",", "?", "\", except the redirection
operators (&lt, &gt) in part3 and the pipeline operator (|) required in part4.</li>
<li>Given a properly configured searching pathnames (see part2), your shell should be able to run all Linux shell commands, such as ls, pwd, cat, ..., etc.</li>
<li>If the command cannot be found, a propriate error message must be printed and the shell should be waiting for the next command.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(30 points) Internal commands (running in the main process rather than the child process):
<ul>
<li><tt>exit</tt>: to exit the floppy shell.</li>
<li><tt>cd</tt>: is a command, obviously, to change directories.  You may want to use the chdir system call.</li>
<li><tt>path</tt>: is not only a command to show the current command searching pathnames 
(if no argument is provided), but also a utility to modify (either add or remove) the 
command searching pathnames.  Hint: you must locally maintain a character string 
to hold the current pathnames, and your main program should be able to modify the 
string given the commands like "path + ..." or "path - ...". Given any user 
entered command, as long as it is not an internal command, your program must first 
determine whether it is a build-in command (the executable can be found in the current
directory).  If it is not, your program then tries the possible existing shell commands 
(by using the maintained searching pathnames). If a 
command is neither a build-in command, nor a shell command, your shell should 
output an error message.
<ul>
<li><tt>path (without arguments)</tt> displays the pathnames currently set.  e.g., "/bin:/sbin"</li>
<li><tt>path + /abc/def</tt> appends the pathname "/abc/def" to the "path" variable.  e.g., 
"/bin:/sbin:/abc/def".</li>
<li><tt>path - /abc/def</tt> removes the pathname "/abc/def" from the "path" variable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(20 points) The floppy shell build-in commands (running in the child process):
<ul>
<li>help: show the commands supported in the floppy shell, including the build-in commands and the local external commands.</li>
<li>traverse [-l]: list the content in the root directory. The "-" option is used to list all detailed information, including the file attribution, the last modified time, the size, the full pathname and the starting cluster ID.</li>
<li>showsector [sector number]: show the contents (in hex dump) of the specified sector number.</li>
<li>showfat: show the content of FAT table (in the hex dump).</li>
<li>For all above commands, you may assume the file name "imagefile.img" is 
equivalent to a floppy disk. That is, you may want to hard code it in your program.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(15 points) I/O output redirection (&gt): your floppy shell should support output redirection.  In particular, if the following command is entered:
<pre>
$ flop: showsector 10 &gt myfile
</pre>
The screen output will be redirected to a local file named "myfile". This redirection capability should work for all commands that produce screen output in your floppy shell.
<ul>
<li>You may want to use open(), close(), dup2() system calls.</li>
<li>Please refer to Unix <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor">file descriptors</a>
for the mapping of <tt>stdin</tt>, <tt>stdout</tt> and <tt>stderr</tt> to 0, 1, 2.</li>
<li>Your shell does not need to handle rediction for build-in commands: <tt>exit</tt>, <tt>cd</tt>, 
<tt>path</tt>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(20 points) Extend you shell with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29">
pipeline (|)</a>.  Given the following command, 
<pre>$ cmd1 | cmd2 </pre> 
the standard output
of <tt>cmd1</tt> is connected to the standard input of <tt>cmd2</tt>.
<ul>
<li>You may want to use <tt>pipe()</tt> system call.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(10 points) This is optional (as a bonus) for undergrads, but is required for grads.  Further extend your shell to support a mixture of pipelines and redirections like
the following examples: 
<pre>
$ cmd1 | cmd2 > file1
</pre>
</li>

<li>Provide a Makefile so <tt>make</tt> command would produce the executable.</li>
<li>
(5 points) Readme: you are required to write a README document (TXT only) that
describes your project design detail and the execution sequence (with the commands).
In particular, please explicitly state which part, if there is any, does not work and 
the possible reasons why that module does not work.  For those working modules, please give
a brief (in short) sample output.
</li>
